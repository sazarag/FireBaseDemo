# FireBaseDemo
Firebase gives you the tools and infrastructure you need to build better apps and grow successful businesses.

Firebase is a mobile and web application platform with tools and infrastructure designed to help developers build high-quality apps. 
It is made up of complementary features that developers can mix-and-match to fit their needs. 
The team is based in San Francisco and Mountain View, California. 
The company was founded in 2011 by Andrew Lee and James Tamplin.
Firebase's initial product was a realtime database, which provides an API that allows developers to store and sync data across multiple clients. 
Over time, it has expanded its product line to become a full suite for app development. 
The company was acquired by Google in October 2014 and a significant number of new features were featured in May 2016 at Google I/O.

At this demo I developed a test aplication and upload the puplished code to web hosting by firebase.
